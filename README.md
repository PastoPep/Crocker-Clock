# Crocker-Clock
Manipulatable Clock

## Goal
Create a **digital clock** that runs for an exact time, but displays an altered value. The clock will be an electronic digital clock app that can be displayed and manipulated in real time from his screen. Specifically, the real amount of time will be finished in its duration, but based on the input, the clock’s displayed time will fluctuate speeds from fast to slower. This project will be done in Java using the java library java.time to implement the clock system.

The goal of this project is to implement to request with key features such as incorrect displayed time, a correct internal clock, many different “fun” features that Mr. Crocker wants us to implement things such as displaying characters instead of numbers, custom audio response, visual screen effects, and a stopwatch that contains features as mentioned above.

The clock should have similar features to common timer software, like SnapTimer and CoolTimer. These features include counting down at a variable time instead of linear, an audio on completion, and attractive visual effects. It should definitely have the ability to stop, start, pause, and reset. On top of these key features, you should be able to manipulate the remaining time at will. If time allows, we may include a stopwatch feature to improve its versatility.


### Helpful Methods -
- System.currentTimeMillis()
- Displays current time in milliseconds
- calculation of the time

Implement Java JFrameTo display the the Timer Fields That Goes along with JFRAME
- EXIT_ON_CLOSE (int)
- DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE (int)
- HIDE_ON_CLOSE (int)
- DO_NOTHING_ON_CLOSE (int)
